With the release of [v0.2.0](https://github.com/danielmatthew/accessible-web-components/releases),I've added support for changing the orientation of the [tabs component](https://danmatthew.co.uk/notes/accessible-web-components-tabs/). The presence of a boolean `vertical` attribute will set `aria-orientation="vertical"`.
