* Two weeks off work over the Christmas break: I'm glad to turn my brain off.
* Received some news on Christmas Eve which I've been pondering over.
* Caught up with [Pluribus](https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/pluribus/umc.cmc.37axgovs2yozlyh3c2cmwzlza) and [Stranger Things](https://www.netflix.com/title/80057281). One was significantly better than the other.
