title: The Path to Mastery
---

After reading [Zach Wentz's Medium post on CodeSchool](https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/56ed7faaad58), I resolved to reminding myself of the concepts I'd encountered while studying for my Computer Science degree.

Wentz's key point is that:
> To truly master the art of programming, we must learn the techniques available to us, not just the tools. Data structures, algorithms, design patterns, and computer science concepts are what Iâ€™m talking about here.

Of them, some came back incredibly quickly, while others were new - and I'm glad to have refreshed my memory, because they are genuinely interesting topics.

I've been drafting a series of posts that cover each of the topics Wentz suggested - I hope they're of use.
