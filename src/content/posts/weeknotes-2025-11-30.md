* Spent the start of the week in Amsterdam. Long day travelling home on Wednesday, with strikes in Belgium adding an extra 90 minutes to the 4 ½ hour journey from Amsterdam Centraal to London St Pancras. Plus the subsequent 80 minutes on the train from London to Leamington. 
* Thought I'd given my hip/groin enough rest but an exploratory run on Saturday caused it to flare up again.
