title: Using JavaScript's bind() function

---

<p class="lead">Since it was introduced in 2009â€™s ECMAScript 5 (ES5) specification, all functions have the <code>bind()</code> method. Using it creates a new function that calls the original with some arguments already fixed. This is known as a "partial function application".</p>

## Using `bind` to set parameters

Partially applying a function using `bind()` allows us to fill in arguments before the function is called. In the following example, `bind()` is used to create a new function that takes `add()`, but only requires a single parameter: `x` is always going to be 1:

```js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

var plus1 = add.bind(null, 1);
console.log(plus1(5)); // 6
```

## Using `bind` to set `this`

`bind()` can also be used to allow the developer to specify the context in which `this` must be used. In the example above, we passed `null`. In the next, we don't pass any additional arguments, but provide the function an object. As we [learnt previously](/2015/04/24/this-and-that-in-javascript/), `this` is bound explicitly when set this way.

```js
function foo(something) {
  console.log(this.a, something);
  return this.a + something;
}

var obj = {
  a: 2,
};

var bar = foo.bind(obj);

var b = bar(3); // 2 3
console.log(b); // 5
```
