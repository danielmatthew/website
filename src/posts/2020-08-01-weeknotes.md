- I spent a day off watching a series of talks from [JAMstack Conf](https://www.youtube.com/c/JAMstackConf), before getting wet and wild out on the bike: that was not a pleasurable experience.
- This week I have been getting to grips with Figma. DesignLab's [Introduction to Figma](https://trydesignlab.com/figma-101-course/introduction-to-figma/), alongside [Sketch Together's video content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0H4NW5ILto) have been useful.
- This resulted in the illustration at the beginning of the page, inspired by [RISD's](https://www.risd.edu) work for the 2006 Winter Olympics. I wanted to play with animation, and SVG will make that easier to achieve.
- At Talis, we've been working hard to improve the interactive states of our interface elements [to correct issues with contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast).
- I played my first-ever game of Fortnite on Switch, and took the Victory Royale. I think I've peaked for 2020.
- Rode RLSCC's bash again this week and beat last week's time by a couple of minutes. I've started adding some run training back into the schedule to maintain that fitness.
